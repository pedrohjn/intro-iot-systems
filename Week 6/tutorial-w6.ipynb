Consider the following situation:\n\n> Two friends must decide what movie to watch at the cinema. Alice would like to watch a sport movie and Bob would like to watch a comedy. Importantly they would both rather spend their evening together then apart.\n\nTo represent this mathematically we will associate **utilities** to the 4 possible outcomes:\n\n1. Alice watches a sport movie, Bob watches a comedy: Alice receives a utility of $1$ and Bob a utility of $1$.\n2. Alice watches a comedy, Bob watches a sport movice: Alice receives a utility of $0$ and Bob a utility of $0$.\n3. Alice and Bob both watch a sport movie: Alice receives a utility of $3$ and Bob a utility of $2$.\n4. Alice and Bob both watch a comedy: Alice receives a utility of $2$ and Bob a utility of $3$.\n\nThis is referred to as the \"battle of the sexes\" and we will represent it using two matrices, $A$ will represent the utilities of Alice:\n\n$$\nA = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 1\\\\\n0 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nand matrix $B$ will represent the utilities of Bob:\n\n$$\nB = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1\\\\\n0 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe refer to **Alice as the row player** and **Bob as the column player**: \n\n- The row player chooses which row of the matrices the players will gain their utilities;\n- The column player chooses which column of the matrices the player will gain their utilities.\n\nThus if the row player (Alice) chooses the first row (this corresponds to a sport movie) and the column player (Bob) chooses the second column (this corresponds to a comedy):\n\n- The row player receives a utility of $A_{12}=1$\n- The column player receives a utility of $B_{12}=1$\n\nThis representation of the stategic interaction between Alice and Bob is called a **Normal Form Game**.\n\nWe can use Python to represent these games, we will use the `nashpy` library to do so and we start by building our two matrices:"
